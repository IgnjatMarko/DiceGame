Rules
-    Player 1 starts first on the left.
-    Each player has their own bank in which they collect points
-   Gamemaster rolls the dice and tallies the total of points
    obtained by the dice. So, GM can click the button to roll the dice and randomly collect points in
    players cash register until they say stop.
-    Now you are wondering why stop? Let's introduce a bit of risk, and if the number 1 comes
    out, the cash register is reset to 0, and if the number 6 comes out, it goes to the next player with the
    reset of only the points won in the current roll. For example, I have 24 and I roll I get a 4 so 5
    and I get a six and nothing I'm left on 24 and the roll goes to the next one.
-   The winner is whoever gets to 101 first!
